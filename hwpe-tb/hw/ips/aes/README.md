Verilog implementation of the [symmetric block cipher AES (NIST FIPS 197)](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf).


## Status ##
The core is completed, has been used in several FPGA and ASIC
designs. The core is well tested and mature.


## Introduction ##

This implementation supports 128 and 256 bit keys. The
implementation is iterative and process one 128 block at a time. Blocks
are processed on a word level with 4 S-boxes in the data path. The
S-boxes for encryption are shared with the key expansion and the core
can thus not do key update in parallel with block processing.

The encipher and decipher block processing datapaths are separated and
basically self contained given access to a set of round keys and a
block. This makes it possible to hard wire the core to only encipher or
decipher operation. This allows the synthesis/build tools to optimize
away the other functionality which will reduce the size to about
50%. This has been tested to verify that decryption is removed and the
core still works.

For cipher modes such as CTR, CCM, CMAC, GCM the decryption
functionality in the AES core will never be used and thus the decipher
block processing can be removed.

This is a fairly compact implementation. Further reduction could be
achived by just having a single S-box. Similarly the performane can be
increased by having 8 or even 16 S-boxes which would reduce the number
of cycles to two cycles for each round.


## Branches ##

There are several branches available that provides different versions of
the core. The branches are not planned to be merged into master. The
branches available that provides versions of the core are:


### on-the-fly-keygen ###

This version of AES implements the key expansion using an on-the-fly
mechanism. This allows the initial key expansion to be removed. This
saves a number of cycles and also remove almost 1800 registers needed to
store the round keys. Note that this version of AES only supports
encryption. On-the-fly key generation does not work with
decryption. Decryption must be handled by the block cipher mode - for
example CTR.


### dual-keys ###

This version of AES supports two separate banks of expanded keys to
allow fast key switching between two keys. This is useful for example in
an AEAD mode with CBC + CMAC implemented using a single AES core.


### cmt-sbox ###

An experimental version of the core in which the S-box is implemented
using circuit minimized logic functions of a ROM table. The specific
table used is
[the 113 gate circuit](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/peralta/CircuitStuff/SLP_AES_113.txt) by the [CMT team at Yale](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/peralta/CircuitStuff/CMT.html).

## Core Usage

### Usage sequence:
1. Load the key to be used by writing to the key register words.
2. Set the key length by writing to the config register.
3. Initialize key expansion by writing a one to the init bit in the control register.
4. Wait for the ready bit in the status register to be cleared and then to be set again. This means that the key expansion has been completed.
5. Write the cleartext block to the block registers.
6. Start block processing by writing a one to the next bit in the control register.
7. Wait for the ready bit in the status register to be cleared and then to be set again. This means that the data block has been processed.
8. Read out the ciphertext block from the result registers.
